    Hi, I'm Matt! I'm a developer living in Austin. I mostly develop web
    applications for scientists to help them be more productive in their science.
    Whether it's data management, point-and-click access to computational resources,
    or the more mundane, I help to make sure scientists and researchers can focus
    more time and effort on their science, and not the technology that has become
    inextricable from large-scale, comuptationally- or data-intensive science.
